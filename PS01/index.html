               When Data Dances
            </h3>
            <p>
                Inspired by the Dear Data project, I have devoted my semester to exploring unconventional, creative, and artistic ways of visualizing data this semester.  As a dancer dealing with a career changing injury I am entering a significant life transition. In this transition, I have decided to explore dancing in a broader sense: How can I continue dancing without physically moving? How can I incorporate my dance knowledge into my other studies? How can I choreograph movement of something other than the body? Through these explorations it became obvious to me, data visualization can become an alternate form of choreography! I will make the data dance.

                My data takes a look at the anxieties and anticipations of dancers as they think about transitions to post-performance careers, data courtesy of The aDvANCE Project: A study of Career Transition for Professional Dancers [2003].  Both current and former professional dancers answered mirrored questions regarding a career transition. Two different approaches to visualization are explored here as I attempt to choreograph a dance of data.
